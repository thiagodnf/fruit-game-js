> https://fruit-game-js.herokuapp.com

Create a new room and set the timer for the game. For now, the available options are:

    - 30 seconds
    - 60 seconds
    - 120 seconds

To move the character, please use the arrows key from your keyboard. Win the game who reaches the higher number of points.

Every second, a new fruit comes up on the board. Each fruit has a number of points and a probability of coming up:

 - **Banana** - 1 point (Probability of 80%)
 - **Apple** - 3 points (Probability of 15%)
 - **Grape** - 5 points (Probability of 5%)
